## Introduction:

Many moons ago, I stumbled upon my leadership style, which I now recognise as “servant leadership.” It’s a path I initially treaded out of insecurity, but it led to profound insights and positive outcomes.

I found myself at the helm of a team of fifty-plus brilliant software engineers—individuals who where way smarter then me. The thought of standing before them, dictating orders, filled me with dred. What if I made a mistake? What if they laughed me out of the room? I needed a different approach.

## A Simple Strategy:

After a few sleepless nights, I devised a straightforward plan: I would ask them what to do. Instead of assuming I had all the answers, I set the stage differently. 

Problem Statements: I presented the team with well-defined problem statements, these challenges became our shared focus.

Workshops and Facilitation: Rather than imposing solutions, I facilitated workshops. We brainstormed, debated, and collaborated. 

Humility and Learning: I embraced my imperfections openly. Servant leadership allowed me to admit when I didn’t know something. In doing so, I fostered an environment where everyone felt safe to learn and grow.

## The Impact:

Ownership: The Team took ownership of the decisions and bought into the changes we were making, we aligned tech stacks and practice among many other things. 

Trust: I like to think I also facilitated a mutual respect and trust with my team. (some of them are on here, so I’m sure I find out) 

Empowerment: Empowering others became my superpower. I didn’t need to be the smartest person in the room—I needed to enable others to shine.

## The Lesson:

Servant leadership isn’t about weakness; it’s about strength. It’s recognizing that leadership isn’t a solo act; it’s a symphony where every instrument matters.
